\title{Determine years lived with disability (YLD) attributable to the incidence of a specific morbidity health outcome
Calculates the YLDs using a single value for baseline heath data, i.e. without life table. It provides as a result the mean as well as the lower and the higher bounds of the morbidity impact based on the confidence interval of the exposure-response function.}

\arguments{
\item{dw}{\code{Numeric value} showing the disability weight associated with the morbidity health outcome population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{exp}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or \code{vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Numeric vector} showing the proportion of population exposed (as a fraction, i.e. values between 0 and 1) for a single exposure value or for multiple categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input must match that of "exp". By default, 1 if a single exposure value is inputted}

\item{cutoff}{\code{Numeric value} showing the cut-off exposure in ug/m3 (i.e. the exposure level below which no health effects occur).}

\item{rr}{\code{Numeric vector} of three numeric values referring to the mean as well as the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval.}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} showing the increment of the concentration-response function in ug/m3 (usually 10 or 5).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} to choose among "linear" and "loglinear".}

\item{bhd}{\code{Numeric value} showing the baseline health data (incidence of the health outcome in the population).}

\item{info_pollutant}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the pollutant. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_outcome}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the health outcome. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_exp}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the exposure. This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_cutoff}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for counter-factual scenario (cut-off). This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_rr}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the concentration-response function. This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_bhd}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the baseline health data. This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. mean, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
The YLDs are listed in the columns:
\itemize{
 \item yld
 \item yld_rounded
 }
