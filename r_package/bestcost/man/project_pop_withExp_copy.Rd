\title{Get population for single year with change in air pollution exposure}
\usage{
project_pop_withExp_copy(lifetable_withPop, year_of_analysis, paf)
}
\arguments{
\item{lifetable_withPop}{\code{Data frame} with three columns: the first one should refer to age, the second one to the probability of dying and the third one to the population (sex specific),}

\item{year_of_analysis}{Numeric value of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table}

\item{paf}{Population attributable fraction}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with the life table plus an additional column for population one year later without changing air pollution exposure.
