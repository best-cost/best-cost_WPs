\arguments{
\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or {vector} showing the proportion of population exposed (as a fraction, i.e. values between 0 and 1) for a single exposure value or for multiple categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input variable should be the same as "exp". By default, 1 for single exposure value will be assigned to this input variable assuming a single exposure value, but users can change this value.}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or {vector} showing the population exposed for each of the exposure categories. The length of this input variable must be the same as "exp".}

\item{cutoff}{\code{Numeric value} showing the cut-off exposure in ug/m3 (i.e. the exposure level below which no health effects occur).}

\item{erf_increment}{\code{Numeric value} showing the increment of the concentration-response function in ug/m3 (usually 10 or 5).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} showing the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed using the relative risk from the literature as support point. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".}

\item{min_age}{\code{Numberic value} of the minimal age to be considered for adults (by default 30, i.e. 30+).}

\item{max_age}{\code{Numberic value} of the maximal age to be considered for infants/children (by default 0, i.e. below 1 year old).}

\item{info}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the pollutant. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}

\item{method}{\code{String} showing the calculation methods.}

\item{exp}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{rr}{\code{Vector} of three numeric values referring to the central estimate as well as the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval.}

\item{erf_c}{\code{String} showing the user-defined function that puts the relative risk in relation with concentration. The function must have only one variable: c, which means concentration. E.g. "3+c+c^2". Default value = NULL.}

\item{bhd}{\code{Numeric value} showing the baseline health data (incidence of the health outcome in the population).}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with all input data together
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
