\arguments{
\item{exp}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3.}

\item{cf}{\code{Numeric value} showing the counter-factual scenario (i.e. minimum cut-off concentration) in ug/m3.}

\item{crf}{\code{Vector} of three numeric values referring to the mean as well as the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval.}

\item{bhd}{\code{Numeric value} showing the baseline health data (incidence of the health outcome in the population).}

\item{crf_per}{\code{Numeric value} showing the increment of the concentration-response function in ug/m3 (usually 10 or 5).}

\item{crf_rescale_method}{\code{String} to choose among "linear" and "loglinear".}

\item{info_pollutant}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the pollutant. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_outcome}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the health outcome. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_exp}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the exposure. This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_cf}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for counter-factual scenario (cut-off). This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_crf}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the concentration-response function. This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_bhd}{\code{String} showing additional information or id for the baseline health data. This information will be added to all rows of the results. Default value = NULL.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. mean, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
Moreover, the data frame include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
Calculates the health impacts, mortality or morbidity, of an environmental stressor using a single value for baseline heath data, i.e. without life table. It provides as a result the mean as well as the lower and the higher bound of the impact based on the confidence interval of the concentration-response function.
