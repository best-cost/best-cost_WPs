\title{Get population impact over time}
\usage{
get_pop_impact(lifetab_withPop, year_of_analysis, paf)
}
\arguments{
\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table}

\item{paf}{\code{Data frame} with three rows (mean, lower bound and upper bound)}

\item{lifetable_withPop_male}{\code{Data frame} with three columns: the first one should refer to age, the second one to the probability of dying and the third one to the population (sex specific),}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. mean, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
Moreover, the data frame include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
