\title{Get population impact over time}
\usage{
get_pop_impact_copy(
  lifetab_withPop,
  year_of_analysis,
  pop_fraction,
  outcome_metric
)
}
\arguments{
\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table}

\item{pop_fraction}{\code{Data frame} showing the PAF (population attributable fraction) or PIF (population impact fraction) in three rows (central, lower bound and upper bound)}

\item{outcome_metric}{\code{String} to define the outcome metric. Choose between "death", "yll" and "yld"}

\item{lifetable_withPop_male}{\code{Data frame} with three columns: the first one should refer to age, the second one to the probability of dying and the third one to the population (sex specific),}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. central estimate, lower and upper bound confidence interval).
Moreover, the data frame include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
