#' Get population over time
#' @param lifetable_withPop \code{Data frame} with three columns: the first one should refer to age, the second one to the probability of dying and the third one to the population (sex specific),
#' @param year_of_analysis Numeric value of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table
#' @param paf \code{Data frame} with three rows (central estimate as well as lower and upper bound)
#' @param outcome_metric \code{String} to define the outcome metric. Choose between "death", "yll" and "yld"
#' @return
#' This function returns a \code{data.frame} the population over time taking into account probability of dying
#' @import dplyr
#' @import tibble
#' @examples
#' TBD
