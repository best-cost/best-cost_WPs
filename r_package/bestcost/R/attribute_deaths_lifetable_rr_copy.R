# Title and description

#' Attributable deaths based on life tables
#'
#' Calculates the premature deaths attributable to the exposure to an environmental stressor using a life table approach. It provides the central estimate of the impact and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (based on the 95\% confidence interval exposure-response function).
#' @param exp \code{Numeric values} Population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).
#' @param prop_pop_exp \code{Numeric value} or {Numeric vector} Fraction (values between 0 & 1) of the total population exposed to (one or more) exposure categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input variable should be the same as "exp". By default, 1 for single exposure value will be assigned to this input variable assuming a single exposure value, but users can change this value.
#' @param cutoff \code{Numeric value} showing the cut-off exposure in ug/m3 (i.e. the exposure level below which no health effects occur).
#' @param rr \code{Numeric vector} of three numeric values referring to the central estimate of the exposure-response function and the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.
#' @param erf_increment \code{Numeric value} showing the increment of the exposure-response function in ug/m3 (usually 10 or 5).
#' @param erf_shape \code{String} showing the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed using the relative risk from the literature as support point. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".
#' @param erf_c \code{String} showing the user-defined function that puts the relative risk in relation with concentration. The function must have only one variable: c, which means concentration. E.g. "3+c+c^2". Default value = NULL.
#' @param first_age_pop \code{Numeric value} starting age of the youngest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year)
#' @param last_age_pop \code{Numeric value} ending age of the oldest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year)
#' @param prob_natural_death_male \code{Numeric vector} containing the probability of dying due to natural cause (excluding non-natural deaths due to violence or accidents) by age or age group for males.
#' @param prob_natural_death_female \code{Numeric vector} containing the probability of dying due to natural cause (excluding non-natural deaths due to violence or accidents) by age or age group for females.
#' @param prob_total_death_male \code{Numeric vector} containing the probability of dying due to all causes (including non-natural deaths due to violence or accidents) by age or age group for males.
#' @param prob_total_death_female \code{Numeric vector} containing the probability of dying due to all causes (including non-natural deaths due to violence or accidents) by age or age group for females.
#' @param population_midyear_male \code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year male population for the year of analysis.
#' @param population_midyear_female \code{Vector} containing the mid-year female population for the year of analysis.
#' @param year_of_analysis \code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table.
#' @param min_age \code{Numberic value} of the minimal age to be considered for adults (by default 30, i.e. 30+).
#' @param max_age \code{Numberic value} of the maximal age to be considered for infants/children (by default 0, i.e. below 1 year old).
#' @param info \code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.
#' @return
#' TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
#' concentration-response function (i.e. central, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
#' Moreover, the data frame include columns such as:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Attributable fraction
#'  \item Health impact
#'  \item Outcome metric
#'  \item And many more.
