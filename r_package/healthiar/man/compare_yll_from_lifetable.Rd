\arguments{
\item{approach_comparison}{\code{String} showing the method of comparison. Options: "delta" or "pif".}

\item{exp_central_1}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution in the scenario 1.}

\item{exp_central_2}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution in the scenario 2.}

\item{prop_pop_exp_1}{\code{Numeric value} or {vector} showing the proportion of population exposed in the scenario 1. The value is a fraction, i.e. values between 0 and 1) for a single exposure value or for multiple categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input variable should be the same as "exp". By default, 1 for single exposure value will be assigned to this input variable assuming a single exposure value, but users can change this value.}

\item{prop_pop_exp_2}{\code{Numeric value} or {vector} showing the proportion of population exposed in the scenario 2. The value is a fraction, i.e. values between 0 and 1) for a single exposure value or for multiple categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input variable should be the same as "exp". By default, 1 for single exposure value will be assigned to this input variable assuming a single exposure value, but users can change this value.}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric values} referring to the central estimate of the relative risk and the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{erf_increment}{\code{Numeric value} showing the increment of the concentration-response function in ug/m3 (usually 10 or 5).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} showing the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed using the relative risk from the literature as support point. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{Equation of the user-defined exposure-response function that puts the relative risk (y) in relation with exposure (x). If the function is provided as \code{string}, it can only contains one variable: x (exposure). E.g. "3+x+x^2". If the function is provided as a \code{function}, the object should have a function class. If only the values of the x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) of the dots in the exposure-response function are available, a cubic spline natural interpolation can be assumed to get the function using, e.g., \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}}

\item{approach_exposure_1}{\code{String} showing whether air pollution is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant"}

\item{approach_newborns_1}{\code{String} showing whether newborns are considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns"}

\item{first_age_pop_1}{\code{Numeric value} starting age of the youngest age group from population and life table data in the scenario 1.}

\item{last_age_pop_1}{\code{Numeric value} ending age of the oldest age group from population and life table data in the scenario 1.}

\item{population_midyear_male_1}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year male population for the year of analysis of the scenario 1.}

\item{population_midyear_female_1}{\code{Vector} containing the mid-year female population for the year of analysis.}

\item{year_of_analysis_1}{\code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table in the scenario 2.}

\item{approach_exposure_2}{\code{String} showing whether air pollution is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant"}

\item{approach_newborns_2}{\code{String} showing whether newborns are considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns"}

\item{first_age_pop_2}{\code{Numeric value} starting age of the youngest age group from population and life table data in the scenario 2.}

\item{last_age_pop_2}{\code{Numeric value} ending age of the oldest age group from population and life table data in the scenario 2.}

\item{population_midyear_male_2}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year male population for the year of analysis of the scenario 2.}

\item{population_midyear_female_2}{\code{Vector} containing the mid-year female population for the year of analysis.}

\item{year_of_analysis_2}{\code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table.}

\item{dw_central, dw_lower, dw_upper}{Three \code{Numeric value} showing the disability weights (central estimate, lower and upper 95% confidence intervals) associated with the morbidity health outcome}

\item{min_age}{\code{Numberic value} of the minimal age to be considered for adults (by default 30, i.e. 30+).}

\item{max_age}{\code{Numberic value} of the maximal age to be considered for infants/children (by default 0, i.e. below 1 year old).}

\item{geo_id_raw}{\code{Vector} showing the id code of the each geographic area considered in the assessment. If a vector is entered here, the data for each geographical area have to be provided as list in the corresponding arguments.}

\item{info_1}{\code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id of the scenario 1. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_2}{\code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id of the scenario 1. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}

\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. central estimate, lower and upper bound confidence interval).
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
Calculates the years of life lost between two scenarios (e.g. before and after a intervention in a health impact assessments). It provides as a result the central estimate as well as the lower and the higher bound of the confidence interval based on the uncertainty of the exposure-response function.
