\arguments{
\item{approach_multiexposure}{\code{String} showing the approach that has to be used in assessments with multiple exposures. To choose among: "additive", "multiplicative" or "combined".}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric values} of the exposure to the environmental stressor referring to the central estimate and (optionally) to lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. If only one value is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3. If a {vector} is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to the exposure categories (average exposure in the category) in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or {Numeric vector} Fraction (values between 0 & 1) of the total population exposed to (one or more) exposure categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input variable should be the same as "exp". By default, 1 for single exposure value will be assigned to this input variable assuming a single exposure value, but users can change this value.}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric values} referring to the central estimate of the relative risk and the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{erf_increment}{\code{Numeric value} showing the increment of the exposure-response function in ug/m3 (usually 10 or 5).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} showing the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed using the relative risk from the literature as support point. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} referring to the equation of the user-defined exposure-response function. If a \code{string} is entered, the function must contains only one variable: x (exposure). E.g. "3+x+x^2". If a \code{function} is entered, it has to have a function class. If only the values of the x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) of the dots in the exposure-response function are available, a cubic spline natural interpolation can be assumed to get the function using, e.g., \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}}

\item{approach_exposure}{\code{String} showing whether air pollution is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant"}

\item{approach_newborns}{\code{String} showing whether newborns are considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns"}

\item{first_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} starting age of the youngest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year)}

\item{last_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} ending age of the oldest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year)}

\item{population_midyear_male, population_midyear_female}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year male population for the year of analysis for male and female respectively.}

\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table.}

\item{min_age}{\code{Numberic value} of the minimal age to be considered for adults (by default 30, i.e. 30+).}

\item{max_age}{\code{Numberic value} of the maximal age to be considered for infants/children (by default 0, i.e. below 1 year old).}

\item{info}{\code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}

\item{time_horizon}{\code{Numeric value} corresponding to time horizon (number of years) for which the impacts should be considered. For example, would be 10 if one is interested in the impacts of an intervention during the next 10 years.}

\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. central estimate, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
Moreover, the data frame include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}

\description{
Calculates the years of life lost attributable to the exposure to an environmental stressor using a life table approach. It provides the central estimate of the impact and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (based on the 95\% confidence interval exposure-response function).
